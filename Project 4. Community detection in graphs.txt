Description:
Community detection aims to find groups of nodes (communities) in a graph that are more densely connected internally than externally. It is used in social networks, citation networks, biological systems, and influence mapping. In this project, we'll use a modularity-based approach and Louvain algorithm, which is widely used for efficient community detection.

ðŸ§ª Python Implementation (Community Detection using Louvain Algorithm)
Weâ€™ll use NetworkX and community-louvain for this task.

âœ… Required Packages:
pip install networkx
pip install python-louvain
ðŸš€ Code:
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import community as community_louvain  # This is the python-louvain package
 
# 1. Create a sample graph or load one
G = nx.karate_club_graph()  # A well-known social graph with community structure
 
# 2. Apply Louvain community detection
partition = community_louvain.best_partition(G)
 
# 3. Visualize the communities
pos = nx.spring_layout(G)
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
 
# Color nodes by community
for community_id in set(partition.values()):
    members = [node for node in partition if partition[node] == community_id]
    nx.draw_networkx_nodes(G, pos, nodelist=members, label=f"Community {community_id}", node_size=300)
 
nx.draw_networkx_edges(G, pos, alpha=0.5)
nx.draw_networkx_labels(G, pos, font_size=10)
plt.title("Louvain Community Detection on Karate Club Graph")
plt.axis("off")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
 
# 4. Print community assignments
print("Community assignments:")
for node, comm in partition.items():
    print(f"Node {node} â†’ Community {comm}")
âœ… What It Does:
Uses Louvain algorithm to detect communities based on modularity maximization.

Applies it on the Zacharyâ€™s Karate Club graph (a classic dataset for community detection).

Visualizes communities with distinct colors.
