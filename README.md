# Graph-Neural-Network-Projects-X9C7W2

Description:
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a powerful class of machine learning models that operate on graph-structured data. They have found wide applications in various fields, including social networks, recommendation systems, and bioinformatics. In this project, we'll explore the fundamentals of GNNs and implement a simple GCN (Graph Convolutional Network) from scratch using PyTorch Geometric.
